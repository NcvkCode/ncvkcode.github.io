          <p>In 2024, I enrolled in a web development course where I have been learning HTML and CSS.<br><br>Over the past few months, as I've worked through the course, I gained enough experience to develop my first website.<br><br>So far I am really enjoying the experience of web development, and I hope to continue with it and gain more experience in the coming years.</p>

          <h3 style="font-family: 'Jersey 25', monospace;">Python</h3>
          <p>2022 was the year that I first properly entered the world of programming. I decided to take Computer Science as a GCSE, and as part of the course I began to learn Python.<br><br>As I have now completed the 2 year GCSE course, I have become very familiarised with the language, and still I aim to improve.<br><br>I hope to bring my knowledge of Python to the next level for my A-Level Computer Science course.</p>

          <h3 style="font-family: 'Jersey 25', monospace;">Java / BukkitAPI</h3>
          <p>In 2024, I decided to complete a short, couple week, Java course to get a basic understanding of the language.<br><br>After completing the course I applied my knowledge to the Bukkit API, which allowed me to create Minecraft plugins.<br><br>I am constantly trying to improve my skills by working as hard as I possibly can, potentially wanting to develop plugins for a Minecraft Server in the future.</p>
